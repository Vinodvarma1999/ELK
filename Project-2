	-------------------------< Loading and Analyzing .CSV data on Kibana >------------------------------

Now let's imagine are we have .csv data and we need to load it Let's see how that data will be loaded.

cd /home/ubuntu

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacktPublishing/Kibana-7-Quick-Start-Guide/master/Chapter02/crimes_2001.csv

cd /etc/logstash/conf.d/

sudo nano crimes.conf'

#-------------------------------------START-----------------------------------
			input {
				file {
					path => "/home/ubuntu/crimes_2001.csv"
					start_position => beginning
				}
			}
			filter {
				csv {
					columns => [
							"ID",
							"Case NUmber",
							"Date",
							"Block",
							"IUCR",
							"Primary Type",
							"Description",
							"location Description",
							"Arrest",
							"Domestic",
							"Beat",
							"District",
							"Ward",
							"Community Area",
							"FBI Code",
							"X Coordinate",
							"y Coordinate",
							"Year",
							"Updated On",
							"latitude",
							"longitude",
							"location"
					]
					separator => ","
					}
			}
			output {
				elasticsearch {
					action => "index"
					hosts => ["localhost"]
					index => "crimes"
				}
			}

		change 'path' to '/home/ubuntu/crimes_2001.csv'
  		change output -> elasticsearch -> hosts to ["localhost:9200"]

#--------------------------------------------END---------------------------------------------


sudo systemctl restart logstash

Go to kibana -> management -> kibana -> index patterns -> create index pattern -> wait for data to load up -> 'crimes*' -> next step -> @timestamp -> create index pattern

Go to 'Discover' ->	'crimes*'

If you wish you can save teh filter currently in use by clicking on 'save' above the search bar\

If you want to use more than oone filter you can either use the 'add filter' or type 'keyword and keyword' in the search bar eg. 'FBI code.keyword: 14 and Date.keyword: "05/01/2015" 12:00:00 PM"'

To save this query just hit save and it will save the filter that is your complex query making it easy to acces again

click on 'open' -> you can search for your filter that was saved
